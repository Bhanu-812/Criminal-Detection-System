# Criminal-Detection-System

Overview
The Criminal Detection System is a machine learning project designed to enhance citizen safety and accelerate investigations by identifying interstate and international criminals. Our project leverages advanced facial recognition technology to detect criminals who attempt to conceal their identities using various methods. By connecting with law enforcement and research departments, we aim to contribute to society's welfare through effective criminal identification.
